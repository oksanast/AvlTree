# AvlTree
AVL Tree Implementation in Java.
The program has a method insert() to insert an object to AVL tree (actually this method creates a AVL tree), 
search() to search a value in AVL tree (iterative and recursive), isAVL() to check if a tree is AVL tree, 
create() to create a tree (not AVL though) from ArrayList, and much more.
